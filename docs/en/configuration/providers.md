# Providers and models

Kimi Code CLI supports connecting to multiple LLM platforms simultaneously: one-click login via the Kimi Code managed service, connecting Claude with an Anthropic API key, or connecting third-party inference services via the OpenAI-compatible protocol. Each provider corresponds to a specific API protocol; models are declared on top of providers with their own name, context length, and capabilities. This page explains how to configure each type of provider in `config.toml`.

## Supported provider types

The `type` field in the `providers` table determines which protocol implementation to use:

| Type | Protocol | Typical use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`kimi`](#kimi) | OpenAI-compatible | Kimi Code managed service, Kimi Platform API key |
| [`anthropic`](#anthropic) | Anthropic Messages | Claude model family |
| [`openai`](#openai) | OpenAI Chat Completions | OpenAI and compatible services, DeepSeek, Qwen, etc. |
| [`openai_responses`](#openai_responses) | OpenAI Responses API | OpenAI's newer Responses interface |
| [`google-genai`](#google-genai) | Google GenAI | Gemini API |
| [`vertexai`](#vertexai) | Google GenAI on Vertex | Google Cloud Vertex AI |

All providers communicate with models in streaming mode by default. Capabilities such as thinking, vision, and tool use are matched automatically by model name prefix, so you typically do not need to declare them manually.

**Credential priority**: the key selected by `active_api_key_id` in `api_keys` > `api_key` or `api_key_env` (mutually exclusive alternatives — set exactly one) > `[providers.<name>.env]` sub-table key (only when none of the above is present) > if all are absent, startup fails with an error. Except for the explicitly declared `api_key_env`, the CLI does not fall back to shell environment variables for credentials. See [Config overrides: provider credentials](./overrides.md#provider-credentials).

## `/provider` — interactive provider management

Prefer not to edit TOML by hand? Type `/provider` in the TUI to open the **provider manager**, where you can interactively add or remove providers.

![The /provider provider manager](../../media/provider-manager.jpg)

The manager displays providers as a list of entries grouped by source. Navigation:

- ↑/↓ to move the cursor, ←/→ to page
- `a` to add a key to the selected provider — the add flow also asks for the key's optional proxy — and `s` to make the selected key the active one
- `d` to delete the selected provider or key (with `[y/N]` confirmation)
- `p` to set the provider's proxy, `r` to turn [automatic key rotation](#multiple-api-keys-and-automatic-rotation) on or off (turning it on needs at least two keys)
- Press Enter on the `[ Add New Platform ]` row to add a new provider

Two paths when adding:

- **Known third-party provider**: fetches the model catalog from [models.dev](https://models.dev/), select a provider → enter an API key → select a default model. Vendors whose protocol the catalog does not declare (e.g. xai, openrouter, and other vendor-specific SDKs) are imported as OpenAI-compatible with a "guessed" note; when the catalog provides no usable endpoint, a base URL prompt appears first; proprietary protocols (Amazon Bedrock, Cohere) and unrecognized explicit protocols are refused. Deprecated and alpha-status models are excluded from the import list. If the public catalog is unreachable, the CLI falls back to a built-in snapshot of the catalog, so the import still works offline or in blocked networks
- **Custom registry (api.json)**: paste a custom registry URL and, for private registries, a Bearer token; the CLI automatically creates the `providers` / `models` entries. When a registry entry declares the `env` field (the name of the environment variable holding the API key), the CLI prints it as a hint — set `api_key_env` in `config.toml` yourself to use it. The binding is never automatic: the registry chooses both the variable name and the endpoint the credential is sent to, so it must not decide which of your secrets is read. For private registries the Bearer token itself is still stored as `source.apiKey` so the registry can be refetched on refresh. On later startup, providers from the same registry URL are refreshed together, so upstream provider additions, removals, and model metadata changes are synced.

::: warning
Kimi Code OAuth managed accounts logged in via `/login` do not appear in `/provider`. Use `/login` and `/logout` to manage them.

The same operations are also available in non-interactive environments via the shell command: [`kimi provider`](../reference/kimi-command.md#kimi-provider).

## Multiple API keys and automatic rotation

A provider can hold several API keys at once. Each key is a named entry in the `api_keys` sub-table, and one of them is active: requests carry only the active key's credential. Turning on `rotate_keys` makes the CLI advance to the next key when the active one stops being accepted, which keeps a session alive when a shared key runs out of quota or hits its rate limit.

```toml
[providers.openai]
type = "openai"
active_api_key_id = "team"
rotate_keys = true

[providers.openai.api_keys.team]
key = "sk-xxxxx"
name = "Team"

[providers.openai.api_keys.backup]
key = "sk-yyyyy"
name = "Backup"
proxy_url = "http://127.0.0.1:1080"
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `api_keys` | `table<string, table>` | — | Named key table; each entry has `key`, `name`, and an optional `proxy_url` |
| `active_api_key_id` | `string` | — | ID of the key in use; when unset the provider falls back to the single `api_key` field |
| `rotate_keys` | `boolean` | `false` | Advance to the next key when the active one is rejected |

Rotation is opt-in per provider and needs at least two keys; a provider with a single key behaves exactly as before. Once it is on, the CLI advances to the next key in config-file order and wraps around at the end, and surfaces the switch (provider and key name) as a warning in the session. The trigger is narrow: an HTTP `403` Forbidden, or a rate-limit error that survives the retry budget of the current step. Other failures — `401`, network errors, `5xx` — keep their normal handling. Providers using an `oauth` credential (the `/login` managed account) never rotate.

The switch outlives the session: a rotation writes the new `active_api_key_id` back to `config.toml`, so the next startup keeps using the key the CLI settled on.

Each key may also carry its own `proxy_url` when it has to leave through a different gateway. The proxy resolves per request, key first: the active key's `proxy_url` wins over the provider-level [`proxy_url`](./config-files.md#providers); a key without one inherits the provider value; with neither set, requests go out directly.

## `kimi`

For connecting to Moonshot AI's OpenAI-compatible interface, including the Kimi Code managed service and Kimi Platform API keys.

- Default `base_url`: `https://api.moonshot.ai/v1`
- Credential key names: `KIMI_API_KEY`, `KIMI_BASE_URL`
- Additional capability: supports video upload

```toml
[providers.kimi]
type = "kimi"
base_url = "https://api.moonshot.ai/v1"
api_key = "sk-xxxxx"
```

> When using the Kimi Code managed service, running `/login` automatically configures `base_url` and credentials, so no manual setup is needed.

## `anthropic`

For connecting to the Claude API. Standard Claude models automatically enable vision, tool use, and Thinking (where supported); custom or uncovered models need `capabilities` declared explicitly on `[models.<alias>]`.

- Default `base_url`: follows Anthropic SDK default
- Credential key names: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`
- Default `max_tokens`: inferred per model. To override, set `max_output_size` on the model alias

```toml
[providers.anthropic]
type = "anthropic"
api_key = "sk-ant-xxxxx"

[models."claude-opus-4-7"]
provider = "anthropic"
model = "claude-opus-4-7"
max_context_size = 200000
# max_output_size = 32000  # optional; omit to use the model-inferred default
```

## `openai`

For connecting to the OpenAI Chat Completions protocol, as well as any third-party service compatible with that protocol (override `base_url` as needed).

Third-party reasoning models (DeepSeek, Qwen, One API, etc.) work out of the box: the CLI automatically handles the `reasoning_content` field and `reasoning_effort` injection. If your gateway returns reasoning content under a non-standard field name, set `reasoning_key` on the model alias to override.

- Default `base_url`: `https://api.openai.com/v1`
- Credential key names: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`

```toml
[providers.openai]
type = "openai"
base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
api_key = "sk-xxxxx"
```

## `openai_responses`

Corresponds to OpenAI's newer Responses API, always operating in streaming mode. Configuration is the same as `openai`.

- Default `base_url`: `https://api.openai.com/v1`
- Credential key names: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`

```toml
[providers.openai-responses]
type = "openai_responses"
base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
api_key = "sk-xxxxx"
```

## `google-genai`

For connecting directly to the Google Gemini API. Thinking, vision, and multimodal capabilities are auto-detected by model name.

- Credential key name: `GOOGLE_API_KEY`

```toml
[providers.gemini]
type = "google-genai"
api_key = "xxxxx"
```

To route through a Gemini-compatible proxy or gateway, set `base_url` (or the `GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL` env var); when omitted, the SDK default `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com` is used.

> Give the **host root only**. The Google GenAI SDK appends the API version and path itself (e.g. `/v1beta/models/<model>:generateContent`), so a trailing `/v1beta` would produce a doubled `/v1beta/v1beta/…`.

```toml
[providers.gemini]
type = "google-genai"
api_key = "xxxxx"
base_url = "https://your-gateway.example"
```

## `vertexai`

Shares the same implementation as `google-genai`; setting `type = "vertexai"` switches to the Vertex AI access path.

Authentication follows the standard Google Cloud ADC flow (`gcloud auth application-default login` or a `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` service account JSON); this part is unrelated to Kimi Code. **The project ID and region must be written in the `[providers.vertexai.env]` sub-table**. Simply `export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` in the shell will not be read by the CLI.

```toml
[providers.vertexai]
type = "vertexai"

[providers.vertexai.env]
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT = "my-gcp-project"
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION = "us-central1"
```

```sh
gcloud auth application-default login   # one-time authentication
kimi
```

To route Vertex requests through a custom (e.g. proxied) endpoint, set `base_url` (or the `GOOGLE_VERTEX_BASE_URL` env var); when omitted, the SDK default regional `*-aiplatform.googleapis.com` host is used. As with `google-genai`, give the host root only. The SDK appends `/v1beta1/publishers/google/models/…` itself.

## OAuth and credential injection

The Kimi Code managed service uses OAuth rather than static API keys. After running `/login`, the built-in authentication toolchain automatically writes and refreshes credentials, so no manual configuration is needed in `config.toml` for this.
